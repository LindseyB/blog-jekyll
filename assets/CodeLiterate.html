			<h2>The Importance of a Code Literate Culture</h2>
			There have been a lot of attempts in order to increase code literacy 
by fellow programmers. However, I think we need to first step back and 
examine why code literacy is important prior to attempting to create 
methods to educate. <div class="quote">All thought is a kind of computation. <br><br>- D. Hobbes </div>At
 the core learning to program is heavily about solving problems. Problem
 solving is something that is rather difficult to teach and programming 
provides a nice outlet for this. The necessary logic understanding for 
programming provides a way to express problems in an easier more 
approachable manner. Learning what an algorithm is and even writing an 
algorithm can demonstrate to a student the creative process for solving 
problems. Debugging a piece of code teaches the multiple ways in order 
to examine a problem in order to discover the root cause.<br><br>Programming
 provides an additional creative outlet for many people. Writing code is
 literally writing. You are creating sentences and the general flow of 
writing a program should be rather similar to that of writing anything 
else. From outlining the general flow prior to the writing process to 
the actual process of sitting down and fleshing out the entire piece 
where there is a point of entry, the central guts, and the end. Creating
 a program is simply an art with a different medium.<div class="quote">A programming language is like a natural, human language in that it favors certain metaphors, images, and ways of thinking. <br><br>- S. Papert (in "Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas", 1980</div>Learning
 an understanding of the technology that is ubiquitous in this modern 
world is increasingly important. Those with the knowledge of technology 
are better at using the technological tools than those without. An 
underlying knowledge of how the code is written that drives the world 
demystifies much of our technologies and makes it clearer what abilities
 and limitations such technologies have. <br><br>As it stands at the 
moment the code literate of our society are mostly white men, which 
means the majority of code written today is not representative of our 
society as a whole. People tend write code to solve problems that are 
important to themselves. It is essential that the code literate in our 
society not only grow in size but become more diverse.

                 </script><div class="comment"><b>Shrutarshi Basu</b><br>I
 was having a wine-fueled conversation last night with fellow CS 
graduate students about the correlation between programming aptitude and
 language aptitude -- puns, wordplay, storytelling and the like. They 
didn't entirely agree with me, but I think that at some level it's all 
about communication and expression. We have ideas and thoughts and 
structures in our minds and we want to bring them into the world. We can
 do that by writing literature and poetry or by painting or making music
 or making physical objects or by writing code. My personal goal as a 
graduate student in programming languages is to look at them as a medium
 for human expression, not just mathematical structures.</div><div class="comment"><b>Josh Duncan</b><br>I
 completely agree on diversity. People with different backgrounds have 
different ways of thinking. Different ways of thinking are key to 
solving difficult problems. And when it comes to program design, having 
the input of many different types of people will help to create a more 
usable product.</div><div class="comment"><b>Josh</b><br>Not sure about 
the value of diversity in programming, at least not the sort of 
diversity correlated (or inversely correlated) with white men. I 
treasure diversity in music, literature, and painting because these are 
mediums for self-expression and reflection on the world around us and 
our experience with others within it. Certainly programming is 
self-expression in the same way that any human productions are, but 
programs live within a tighter set of constraints than do productions in
 spoken languages and musical/tonal systems. Help me understand-- what 
sorts of things do people do in programming that come out 
differently--in an interesting way-- when the programmers have different
 backgrounds?</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Josh:
 You can end up with a functional end result no matter what, but coming 
from different backgrounds definitely effects the approach that each 
person will take. Making an effective team to write code is heavily 
where diversity comes into play. Each person brings a different 
perspective to the table and there's really no argument to growing up 
male is quite different from growing up female. <br><br>A team working on some code should be as diverse as its users as they can predict and expect the needs of each individual. <br><br>Also,
 you seem to be forgetting just what people are able to do with code. 
Not all programming is writing some functional product for an end user 
or performing some sort of calculation. Some code is written simply for 
the sake of art and expression. The Demoscene is one really good example
 of this. Additionally, there are those out there who have and continue 
to compose music entirely in code.</div><div class="comment"><b>Josh</b><br>Hey Lindsey, <br><br>Thanks
 for your response.  I agree that different backgrounds conduce to 
different approaches, I just haven't seen the correlations that you have
 between gender, culture, and code styles--which may well be because I 
haven't seen enough code, especially enough code written by people from 
diverse backgrounds-- which makes me really curious about the kinds of 
examples that you and other readers have seen.<br><br>Again, hands down 
no argument against growing up male or female, or from this part of the 
world or that, or this socioeconomic situation or that, etc., having 
worlds to do with who we are, experiences we've had, and what we think, I
 just get stuck on the "how" part-- which to me seems rather constant 
across people from different places.  Don't get me wrong, the "what"s of
 thinking are incredibly important---so much so that I think they must 
account for the diversity of approaches, informed by and alongside the 
differences in spoken languages, values, motivation, and emotions.  <br><br>It's
 a good point about programming being put to non-utilitarian uses as 
well, which you're right to point out-- I hadn't considered that side of
 things.  <br><br>I suppose my main point in all this though, apart from
 sincere curiosity about how different backgrounds conduce to different 
ways of coding, is that it seems to me the larger motivations for a code
 literate culture are the utilitarian ones you articulated in your 
second and fourth paragraphs.  <br><br>Considered as a utilitarian 
activity, I'm really not sure that culturally-driven variations produce 
meaningfully different results.  To use an analogy I suspect you'll 
disagree with (but am not quite sure why), I don't believe the reason 
there aren't more female chess champions or Nobel prize winners or 
prolific programmers has anything to do with the way women think.  Way 
more men have been and are involved in these disciplines than women.  
Reverse that and you'd have a world where women have all the awards, 
only somehow I don't think that women would try to draw the same 
conclusion that men have from that fact-- that women are intellectually 
superior "biologically".  No, I think women would think better of that. 
 So perhaps I'm wrong about all of this.  <br><br>In any case, thanks for the article!</div><div class="comment"><b>Duncan Bayne</b><br>Your statement:<br><br>"As
 it stands at the moment the code literate of our society are mostly 
white men, which means the majority of code written today is not 
representative of our society as a whole. "<br><br>... is both sexist 
and racist.  You assume that sex and race are closely related to 
programming style &amp; preferences.  My experience, based on ten years 
of working with male and female developers from New Zealand, Australia, 
UK, China, Ukraine, Russia, Malysia, Sri Lanka, India and elsewhere, is 
that they aren't.<br><br>I predict that if you gather a group of 
developers that's large enough you'll get a representative spread of 
coding styles, regardless of the sex or race of the developers.</div><div class="comment"><b>Chris</b><br>I
 guess we can expand your last paragraph by saying it's not just all 
"white" men.  We have lots of men of color these days (Indians, 
Europeans, Americans, Asians), but I'll let your point stand.<br><br>We 
don't know why women (generally) don't end up programming.  We just 
formed a new group of 35-40 (Business Analysts, QA people, and 
programmers).  There are no women in the group.  I wish there were more 
women in our group, but there never is.<br><br>I guess I still have a foul taste in my mouth from your last paragraph,  even if I agree with your post.</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Duncan
 Bayne: The point of diversity is not the sake of different coding 
styles it's for the sake of different perspectives. As mentioned in my 
above comment to Josh this can be highly valuable based on the different
 experiences of those participating. <br><br>Chris: The statement is 
rather blunt, but it contains a certain amount of reality. It's not only
 that the programming community suffers from a lack of women, but in the
 U.S. we notice that there is a serious lack of African American 
programmers.</div><div class="comment"><b>Duncan Bayne</b><br>Lindsey,<br><br>Regardless
 of whether we're talking coding styles or general perspectives on life,
 my point stands: you are claiming that one must have representatives of
 different races and sexes in order to get a good spread.<br><br>The 
only reason this claim could be true is if some perspectives (or coding 
styles, take your pick) are specific to (or at least strongly correlated
 with) a given sex or race.<br><br>This is why I'm claiming that your 
opinion is simultaneously sexist and racist.  You are starting from the 
assumption that someone's perspective is dependant upon race or sex.</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Duncan
 Bayne: We do not live in a bubble completely exempt from being treated 
differently based on how we look or who people perceive us to be. If 
that was the case there probably wouldn't be an issue of gender or race 
inequality among programmers. Yet, here we are and there is clearly an 
imbalance. It's naive to ignore this issue and just assume that the 
programming world is already as diverse as it needs to be, clearly there
 is a problem and it is something that needs to be solved.</div><div class="comment"><b>Wilkie</b><br>Fascinating
 comments. Code literacy is the potential to read and write code, and by
 extension the potential to use computation to improve society. We live 
in a segregated world. Computation is not widely available to all 
cultures and as such this may be exploited by those cultures that do. 
That is, we risk being forever segregated by technology. This would be 
extremely dangerous.<br><br>I feel that some people are missing the 
point of the discussion the original author wishes to make, which is the
 connection between code and the written word. From that point, code 
literacy is just as important as general literacy.<br><br>This has 
nothing to do with cultural differences with respect to code style, etc.
 It has to do with the different problems that a culture faces. The 
diversity of the problems will reflect a diversity in how code is used 
to solve them. Furthermore, the usage of these solutions (technology 
overall) will reflect the culture that requires them.<br><br>Therefore, 
we risk the same dangerous segregation as the world had seen with the 
literacy gap. There were those that could read and write, and those who 
could not. Imagine a culture that could benefit from computation, but 
does not have it available. The culture that is cut off from the rest of
 the world, for instance. Or the nation that is censored or has their 
view of the world filtered. Or the under-privileged community that does 
not have computers in their school.<br><br>Is it at a disadvantage? Can 
this be corrected? If these individuals had resources to create new 
forms of technology, what would change? Those are the questions we 
should ask.</div><div class="comment"><b>Wilkie</b><br>Duncan Bayne: The
 "code literate" of our society are white males. This is true. This 
"means the majority of code written today is not representative of our 
society as a whole." Very true. Make this just "literate" and replace 
"code" with "books." If most of the literate were white men and they 
wrote most of our books, which was true at some time, wouldn't you agree
 that this would not be representative of society?</div><div class="comment"><b>max ogden</b><br>we need more code art and less startups! (or, more infinite games and less finite ones)</div><div class="comment"><b>Helen McKay</b><br>I really like the color you have chosen to represent the background of your web station.  It is a very clever choice.</div><div class="comment"><b>Tim Daly</b><br>Lindsey,<br><br>First, I'm amazed that you did not reference Don Knuth about<br>literate programming.<br><br>Second, you might find it worthwhile to look at an example of a<br>fully literate program in the book "Lisp In Small Pieces". This is<br>the best example of a fully executable program in literate style.<br><br>Third, I believe there is a position on software development teams<br>for a "software editor" with the task of requiring all software to be<br>written in a literate style and conforming to normal language rules<br>for the written documentation. The software editor would come from<br>a writing background, not a programming background. Ideally this<br>would be a former book or newspaper editor.<br><br>Fourth, I am a little puzzled about how this has any overtones of<br>"white male"-ness. I worked with well over 100 programmers who<br>were asian, indian, iranian, mexican, and african. I don't recall any<br>way I could distinguish their code from any other code. Could you<br>give an example of "female code"?</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Tim
 Daly: It's not about the end resulting code, it's about the process of 
getting there. I'm speaking to complete lack of certain types of 
programmers. The end result may be the same no matter who the person is 
writing it, but it's about denying computation to certain groups of 
people. Clearly, this sort of segregation is not something that we 
should just accept.</div><div class="comment"><b>john</b><br>you're cute</div><div class="comment"><b>alcuadrado</b><br>Nice article. I'm very interested by the initial quote, but I couldn't find its source in google. Do you have it? :)<br><br>thanks</div><div class="comment"><b>Adam</b><br>"...but
 it's about denying computation to certain groups of people. Clearly, 
this sort of segregation is not something that we should just accept."<br><br>I
 agree that this is something that we should not accept -- if in fact it
 did not exist.  Perhaps it's the demographic of the institution at 
which I earned my Computer Science degrees which has a strong "Women in 
Computer Science" initiative and actively tries to maintain a roughly 
50/50 split between the sexes in department members, but I have never 
seen any kind of "segregation" or "exclusion" of women from any activity
 involving programming.  In fact I'd say the opposite is true: many go 
out of their way to try and involve women whenever possible.<br><br>As 
for multiple perspectives on the development process: absolutely true.  
Having said that, multiple perspectives does not imply having equal 
representation of genders or race.  It means having people with varied 
backgrounds.  Now sure, women and men tend to have different 
backgrounds, however that's not necessarily true.  I know many women in 
tech who have extremely similar backgrounds to my own, which is 
(arguably) why they sought out the same field as myself.  Perhaps 
instead of colouring a lack of diversity in tech as a issue of gender or
 race, perhaps it should be colored as a desire to see varied 
backgrounds and experiences irregardless of how the gender and/or race 
cards play out.</div><div class="comment"><b>Adam</b><br>"I agree that this is something that we should not accept -- if in fact it did not exist."<br><br>Sorry, that was a typo: I agree that this is something that we should not accept -- if in fact it **did** exist.</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Adam:
 I think it's time I come at you with some solid data. While you may not
 observe an imbalance in programmers it does indeed exist: <br><br>http://www.math.buffalo.edu/mad/computer-science/cs-peeps.html - 0.25% of computer scientists are black<br><br>http://www.cra.org/resources/taulbee/
 - "The fraction of women among bachelor's graduates increased this year
 in all three areas (CS, CE and I), though only 13.8 percent of 
bachelor's graduates in CS, 10.4 percent in CE, and 14.5 percent in I, 
were women. "<br><br>http://grokcode.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/programmer-graph3-new3.png
 - and of course we have the graph of famous computer scientists which 
shows cisgender women at 2.93%</div><div class="comment"><b>Adam</b><br>No,
 I am aware of those numbers, what I'm saying is that while the numbers 
aren't equal, that does not imply that there is segregation or exclusion
 occurring.</div><div class="comment admin-comment"><b>Lindsey</b><br>Adam:
 The exclusion I am talking about is that certain groups of people 
aren't involved because they aren't there to be involved.</div><div class="comment"><b>Zack</b><br>Wilkie:
 "Computation is not widely available to all cultures and [...] we risk 
being forever segregated by technology. This would be extremely 
dangerous."<br><br>I wholly agree. I am a first-generation college 
student and also in the first-generation computer-literate in my family.
 Growing up, I had friends whose parents adopted whatever technology 
they could; they understood that it was the future, not just a path to 
the future. So I am eternally grateful that my parents could provide me 
with a tool to learn the future, that they funded my education to 
embrace the future.<br><br>I am now a well-employed software engineer 
working at a well-respected development company. I bring my own 
perspective to problems and place unique and personal importance on 
certain aspects above others. It is my proficiency to provide this 
objectivity into the solution that makes me valuable, not the characters
 in the source code at the end of the day. My literacy lets me adjust 
the solution recipe as I see fit, not exclusively as others may wish.<br><br>Now
 that I am educated, and more importantly earnest, about solving 
problems with computation, I think about countries that solve Internet 
connectivity with chicken wire fence and car batteries, and hope that 
this new technology assists in solving the other problems important to 
them. It's all about learning and doing; but you must have to learn in 
the first place. And, as Wilkie stated before, the threats to this 
literacy of the future are many and significant; we future-literate 
cannot ignore this widening gap for fear of losing the solutions -- and 
approaches to solutions -- the "rest" of the world has to offer.</div>
