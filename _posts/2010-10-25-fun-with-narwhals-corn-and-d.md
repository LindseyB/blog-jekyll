title: Fun with Narwhals, Corn, and D
---

This weekend I took part in a game programming competition at PITT, [OSGCC](http://osgcc.org). My team members (James LL and Jackie Kircher) and myself were given the themes of narwhals and corn to incorporate into our game. Armed with the D programming language James and myself set forth with coding and Jackie tackled the task of creating graphics and picking music. The result was nothing short of amazing. I positively could not be happier with the result of 24 hours of work. I will be modifying and updating this code at some point in the future.
