My team doesn't really love meetings so I have us only meet once a week for a team sync. During this team sync I like to have the team start out with an ice breaker just to get folks talking and to get to know each other more. Our team has had quite a period of change and instability where the members have seemingly continously changed. Additonally, we have a rotation onto our team where folks will join for a period of three months and then leave. That said I've found it helpful to spend time with the team getting to know each other and these ice breakers allow us to do so in a low stakes way. Especially since the majority of the team has not met in person.
