When I speak of code literacy I am simply talking of the expansion of the idea of what we normally think of a literacy just expanded over to programming languages. Additionally, it's not simply a matter of using the language proficiently; it's a matter of being able to use computation as a result of this knowledge.

It's important to keep in mind that this idea is completely separate from Donald Knuth's idea of "Literate Programming". 

<blockquote>
	<p>
		code literacy is: <br>
		the ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate, and use rules that shape and reshape information in order to participate fully in the creation of new information.
