I decided to work on a simple visualization of the timeline of women's contributions to the world of computing. It's largely based on [this wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_computing#Timeline_of_women_in_computing), but it hopes to allow people to explore these women in a more interactive manner. Additionally, I noticed a complete lack of historical knowledge of computing among my students. Many of them could not even tell me who Alan Turing was which is rather shocking since he happens to be one of the more famous historical computer scientists.
