# The What

Original Sims game running in a virtual machine setup.

# The Why

The original Sims no longer is runnable on modern windows even with compatibility modes enabled.

# The How

## Setup a Windows XP Virtual Machine

### Step the First: Download Virtual Box

Go and [download](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) the latest version of virtual box. In some cases for
games you want to download 3.0 and not higher, but it looks like for The Sims that's not a requirement. So, latest will
do.

### Step the Second: Download Windows XP virtual hard disk

Go and [download](https://windows-xp-mode.en.softonic.com/download) the windows XP mode file here. It looks like an
executable, but we will not be using it like that.

### Step the Third: Find an extract VirtualXPVHD

1. Take `WindowsXPMode_en-us.exe` and extract it using your favorite tool, if it asks what format to use specify `.cab`
2. Navigate into `sources` and extract the `xpm` file
3. You should now see a `VirtualXPVHD` file, this should remain here with it's friend files all extracted

### Step the Fourth: Get a copy of The Sims with a crack

I'm sorry, it's the only way. I'd love to tell you to mount all your original CDs and run them, but it's not possible
anymore, because of the DRM. In this case we can agree that they really did this to themselves.

Safest bet is going to [Games4theworld](https://games4theworld.site/sims-downloads/) and downloading
`The Sims 1 - Complete collection`. I recommend extracting the resulting zip file into a folder that you designate
your shared folder for the Windows XP virtual machine.

### Step the Fifth: Create a Windows XP Virtual Machine in virtual box

Most of these steps below are from this [article](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/download-windows-xp-for-free-and-legally-straight-from-microsoft-si/#windows-xp-mode-disk-settings). So, so if you'd perfer screen shots that's the place to go.

1. Open VirtualBox
2. Select **New**
3. Click **Expert Mode**
4. Give your virtual machine a name, I suggest "Windows XP"
5. Assign the virtual machine memory, I did `51713 MB` because I was worried about The Sims running well, but `2048 MB` is probably more sane.
6. Under **Hard Disk**, select **Using existing virtual hard drive file** and select the `VirtualXPVHD` we created in **Step the Third** and click **Open**
7. Now Click **Create**

### Step the Sixth: Configure your virtual machine

1. Click on your virutal machine in virtual box and click **Settings** from the top panel
2. Click on **System**
3. Under **Boot Order**
   a. uncheck **Floppy** and move it to the bottom
   b. move **Hard Disk** to the top
4. Under **Display** increase video memory to `128 MB`
5. **Optional** Under your display settings change the scale factor to `200%` so you can see easier on giant monitors
6. Under **Shared Folders** click the "folder +" icon to add the folder created in **Step the Forth** and make sure you set it to `Auto Mount`
7. Click **Okay** to close and move on

### Step the Seventh: Boot your virtual machine and configure windows

1. In Virtual Box click **Start** to start the virtual machine
2. Follow the instructions to finish the install of windows
3. Make sure to note your administrator password as part of this install (not literally, but it in a password manager if you must)
4. Once windows has fully booted first modify your display settings:
  a. Right-click desktop and select **Properties**
  b. Click on **Settings**
  c. Set the screen resolution to `800x600` and the color quality to `Highest (32 bit)`
  d. Hit **Apply**
5. On the virutal machine window that is running Windows XP click on **Devices > Insert Guest Additions CD Image...**
6. Follow the install steps for **Guest Additions**

### Step the Eigth and Final: Install the Sims

1. Your virtual machine should reboot after the previous step
2. Click on **Start** and then **My computer**
3. Click on the mounted folder it should look something like `WindowsXpFiles on 'VBoxSvr'`
4. It might ask you what to open it with and just select `Internet Explorer` and it will be happy and click **OK**
5. Open The Sims extracted folder we created in **Step the Forth**
6. Click on **start** to start installing The Sims and then follow the instructions in `# Installation Guide.txt`
7. Make sure you've copied the crack as specified in the included install guide and then you can play The Sims
