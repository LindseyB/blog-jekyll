OSGCC was absolutely amazing this year. The games made for it were all impressive. We had a kinect game, a tablet game, a vimscript game, and even a [Dart game](http://koios.co/dmfd/). The source for all of the games will be available on [github](https://github.com/organizations/osgcc) and you can learn more about previous competitions on the [osgcc website](http://osgcc.org/).
