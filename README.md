# Blog


Formally this was https://github.com/LindseyB/blog written in sinatra using ruby. Since there's nothing but static pages and I didn't want to pay for heroku I decided to move this over to GitHub pages. This is now using jekyll and actions to build the pages out.


## Running locally

```bash
bundle install           # install dependencies
bundle exec jekyll serve # run server
```
