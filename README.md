# Blog


Formally this was https://github.com/LindseyB/blog written in sinatra using ruby. Since there's nothing but static pages and I didn't want to pay for heroku I decided to move this over to GitHub pages. This is now using jekyll and actions to build the pages out. 

This uses [the minimal mistakes jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) and I've brushed some css on top to make it look a bit like my old site. I'm still polishing some pieces and attempting to fix dead links/urls. 


## Running locally

```bash
bundle install           # install dependencies
