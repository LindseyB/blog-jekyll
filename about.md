I'm Lindsey: a staff software engineering manager with a degree in computer science who has been programming since I was 12. I love trying to mix art and code in both how I write code and coming up with new projects that find ways to blend the two. Tea is a way of life for me and reading is my one true love.

I'm currently a remote worker for GitHub living in the bay area and a huge fan of both pair programming and [purr programming](https://society6.com/product/purr-programmer_sticker).
